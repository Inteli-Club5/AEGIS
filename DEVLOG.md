# DEVLOG

Append-only. One entry per work session (human or AI). Entries are chronological:
oldest at the top, newest at the bottom. Use English AM/PM timestamps. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm AM/PM - <name or agent> - <lane>
- did: <what changed, files/PRs>
- next: <the single next task>
- blockers: <none | what + who can unblock>
- interfaces touched: <none | which, and the change>
```

## 2026-07-24 12:00 AM - Claude Code (CryptoVictor) - setup
- did: executed SETUP.md end to end per PLAYBOOK.md - merged scaffold-hbar
  (Hedera-wired scaffold-eth-2, submodules included) into the repo root, cloned
  0g-compute-ts-starter-kit into services/decision-verifier, wrote the
  services/cosigner skeleton, moved the architecture doc to
  docs/AEGIS_ARQUITETURA_REFATORADA_V3_FINAL.md, prepended the "start here"
  block to AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (and added an AEGIS-specific section to
  CLAUDE.md), extended .gitignore (.env, .next, foundry out/cache/broadcast),
  ran yarn install + service npm installs, git init on `main`, first commit.
  No TASKS.md item was started - scope was setup only, per instructions. The
  original entry did not record a time; 12:00 AM is used only to keep the
  normalized DEVLOG chronological.
- next: freeze interfaces in docs/interfaces.md with the team (first Shared
  task in TASKS.md), then create a GitHub remote and push.
- blockers: none. Foundry deploy and dashboard dev server were not run -
  deploying needs a funded Hedera testnet key, left for whoever owns that step.
- interfaces touched: none.

## 2026-07-24 05:30 AM - Codex (Leunam) - tooling
- did: installed the `ethskills` Codex skill from
  `austintgriffith/ethskills` root `SKILL.md` into
  `/home/inteli/.codex/skills/ethskills` and verified the installed metadata.
  No AEGIS product task was started.
- next: freeze interfaces in docs/interfaces.md with the team (first Shared
  task in TASKS.md), then create a GitHub remote and push.
- blockers: none.
- interfaces touched: none.

## 2026-07-24 01:20 PM - Claude Code (CryptoVictor) - docs
- did: wrote `docs/AEGIS_ARCHITECTURE.md`, an English production-locked
  rewrite of the old `AEGIS_ARQUITETURA_REFATORADA_V3_FINAL.md` (removed
  mid-session from the working tree). Three previously-open questions are now
  locked: Protected Agent Wallet is a real Safe (2-of-2, not a mock vault),
  The Graph is the indexing layer for dashboard/audit log/Trust Badge
  (promoted from stretch), and ENS is dropped entirely for agent identity
  (AgentProfile + PolicyRegistry + Graph-indexed history instead). Mid-session
  the user also corrected the product thesis: AEGIS creates the AI agent
  itself on Hedera in this version - it is not "bring your own agent" yet
  (that's roadmap) - fixed in §1, §3.2, §15 of the new doc. Seeded
  `docs/decisions.md` (ADR-lite) with all four decisions and updated
  `CLAUDE.md`'s doc pointers to the new file.
- next: `bounty.md`, `x402-bounty.md`, and `TASKS.md` were also deleted from
  the working tree mid-session (not by this agent) - confirm with the team
  whether that's intentional before anyone relies on TASKS.md's "read this
  first" instruction in PLAYBOOK.md/CLAUDE.md, since it currently points at a
  file that no longer exists. After that, freeze `docs/interfaces.md` (still
  the first Shared task as of the last surviving copy of TASKS.md).
- blockers: none for the docs work. TASKS.md is gone so its checkbox for
  "Seed docs/decisions.md" couldn't be marked done there - now done, tracked
  here instead.
- interfaces touched: `docs/AEGIS_ARCHITECTURE.md` supersedes
  `AEGIS_ARQUITETURA_REFATORADA_V3_FINAL.md` as the architecture source of
  truth (loudly noting per PLAYBOOK.md rule 5).

## 2026-07-24 06:49 PM - Codex (Leunam) - tooling
- did: inspected the local 0G agent skills setup. Found `.0g-skills/` cloned
  from `0gfoundation/0g-agent-skills`, confirmed it is currently untracked,
  and confirmed Codex already has the separate `0g-compute` skill installed in
  `/home/inteli/.agents/skills/0g-compute`. No Codex global skill installation
  or project instruction edits were made.
- next: decide whether to keep `.0g-skills/` as local reference, ignore it,
  submodule it, or install/create a clean global Codex wrapper skill for the
  unified 0G repo.
- blockers: `TASKS.md` is still missing, so no task list update was possible.
- interfaces touched: none.

## 2026-07-24 07:48 PM - Codex (Leunam) - 0G Agentic ID
- did: implemented the first AEGIS dashboard 0G Agentic ID integration inside
  `packages/nextjs`. Added `packages/nextjs/integrations/0g/agentic-id/`
  with AgentProfile types, metadata/hash helpers, 0G Galileo chain config, a
  minimal official AgenticID ABI, and `createAgenticIdForAegisAgent(input)`.
  The flow read `mintFee()`, called `iMint(to, datas)`, parsed token ID from
  the `Transfer` event, and called `setTokenURI` when a metadata URI was
  provided. Added local AgentProfile persistence to the existing Zustand store,
  replaced `/` with the AEGIS AgentProfile dashboard, added example metadata at
  `packages/nextjs/public/metadata/agent-profile.json`, added
  `mock-vs-real.md`, and updated Next env defaults for 0G Galileo.
- next: test a live mint with a funded wallet on 0G Galileo and a real
  metadata URI.
- blockers: `TASKS.md` and `docs/interfaces.md` do not exist in this repo, so
  no task checklist or shared interface doc update was possible.
- interfaces touched: `packages/nextjs/integrations/0g/agentic-id/types.ts`
  defined the local AgentProfile and Agentic ID result contract for the
  dashboard. No Hedera deployment artifacts or DecisionVerifier/TeeML/Safe
  interfaces were touched.

## 2026-07-24 08:10 PM - Codex - 0G Agentic ID docs
- did: consolidated the real-vs-fallback documentation into
  `docs/0g/notes/agentic-id-sync-notes.md` and removed the separate
  `packages/nextjs/integrations/0g/agentic-id/mock-vs-real.md` file so 0G
  notes are not scattered inside runtime code directories.
- next: stage only the curated notes, Next.js integration files, metadata
  example, env example, and DEVLOG; keep raw docs/clones/local skills out of
  git.
- blockers: `TASKS.md` and `docs/interfaces.md` are still absent.
- interfaces touched: none.

## 2026-07-24 08:26 PM - Codex - 0G Agentic ID backend
- did: removed the AEGIS Agentic ID dashboard/localStorage/static metadata
  fallback path and converted the integration to a backend-only real flow in
  `packages/nextjs`. Added `POST /api/0g/agentic-id`, 0G Storage metadata
  upload with Merkle root verification and verified download, AgenticID
  `mintFee()` + `iMint()` + `setTokenURI()` + final `transferFrom()` execution,
  and final `ownerOf`/`tokenURI` checks. Updated `PLAYBOOK.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  and `DEVLOG.md` to require chronological DEVLOG entries with English AM/PM
  timestamps. Updated `docs/0g/notes/agentic-id-sync-notes.md` for the
  backend-only no-mock scope.
- next: run a live 0G Galileo registration with funded `ZERO_G_PRIVATE_KEY` and
  persist the returned result in the real AEGIS backend store once that storage
  layer exists.
- blockers: live mint was not run because no funded 0G Galileo private key was
  provided in env. `TASKS.md` and `docs/interfaces.md` are still absent.
- interfaces touched: added backend API `POST /api/0g/agentic-id` and updated
  `packages/nextjs/integrations/0g/agentic-id/types.ts` for the real 0G
  registration result.

## 2026-07-24 08:44 PM - Codex - docs
- did: translated the remaining Portuguese Markdown content in
  `docs/0g/notes/agentic-id-sync-notes.md` to English, preserving technical
  meaning, paths, links, and branch notes. Verified Markdown files with `rg`
  searches for Portuguese accents and strong Portuguese terms.
- next: restore `TASKS.md` or decide the current replacement for task tracking,
  because `PLAYBOOK.md` still requires it.
- blockers: `TASKS.md` is still missing, so no task checklist update was
  possible.
- interfaces touched: none.
