# DEVLOG

Append-only. One entry per work session (human or AI). Newest at the top. This is
how async and shared work stays coherent: read the top entries to know where we
are. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - <name or agent> - <lane>
- did: <what changed, files/PRs>
- next: <the single next task>
- blockers: <none | what + who can unblock>
- interfaces touched: <none | which, and the change>
```

## 2026-07-24 - Claude Code (CryptoVictor) - setup
- did: executed SETUP.md end to end per PLAYBOOK.md - merged scaffold-hbar
  (Hedera-wired scaffold-eth-2, submodules included) into the repo root, cloned
  0g-compute-ts-starter-kit into services/decision-verifier, wrote the
  services/cosigner skeleton, moved the architecture doc to
  docs/AEGIS_ARQUITETURA_REFATORADA_V3_FINAL.md, prepended the "start here"
  block to AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (and added an AEGIS-specific section to
  CLAUDE.md), extended .gitignore (.env, .next, foundry out/cache/broadcast),
  ran yarn install + service npm installs, git init on `main`, first commit.
  No TASKS.md item was started - scope was setup only, per instructions.
- next: freeze interfaces in docs/interfaces.md with the team (first Shared
  task in TASKS.md), then create a GitHub remote and push.
- blockers: none. Foundry deploy and dashboard dev server were not run -
  deploying needs a funded Hedera testnet key, left for whoever owns that step.
- interfaces touched: none.
